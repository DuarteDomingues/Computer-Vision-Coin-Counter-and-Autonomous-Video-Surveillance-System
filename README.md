# Computer-Vision-Coin-Counter-and-Autonomous-Video-Surveillance-System
Computer Vision project to automatically count the values of coin in an image, and an autonomous video surveillance system

### Final project of the subject PIV (Processamento de Imagem e Visão)

Licenciatura Engenharia Informática e Multimédia - ISEL

#### Computer Vision projects using Python and OpenCV.

The first project is based on manipulating images, introducing concepts such as filters, object detection,
data manipulation, to count how many coins, and what their values are in a horizontal plane at a predetermined distance from the ground.

The second project is based on an algorithm capable of being integrated into an autonomous 
autonomous video surveillance system. The algorithm is able to identify the movement of 
objects (active regions) of interest, such as people or cars, and classify these objects 
into one of 3 possible classes (Person, car, other).
